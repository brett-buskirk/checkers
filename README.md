This is a two-player checker game that I created while learning how to code at [The Last Mile](https://thelastmile.org/) in 2019.
  
To load the game, simply open the `index.html` file in a browser window. This can be done easily by dragging the file to a browser page and letting go.

To play the game, drag and drop the pieces to any legal, available space. If the play is not legal, the piece will return to the square it left. According to the rules of checkers, a player must make a jump if one is available. When this happens, the required squares will flash gold. The player can only move an appropriate piece into one of these squares. In addition, multiple jumps can and must be taken.

A piece is "kinged" when it reaches the opposing side of the board. A kinged piece can move either forward or backward across the board. A kinged piece is marked with a white crown.
  
Game play begins with the black pieces and alternates between red and black until one side wins or the players agree that the game is a draw.
